## 一些想法
前几天我花了非常多的精力来搬运之前写的英诗金库的内容，并且在博客里加上了卡片（应该从左边栏可以看到）。在搬运的过程中，我意识到了一些问题。

这个系列是从去年春天开始的。最开始我似乎只是想做一个方便检索诗歌的工具（也是因为原来的平台是WikiDot），收集诗歌的各种翻译，在此过程中顺便读一些诗而已；所以开始时我只是敲字敲得开心，什么诗歌的格律、意象、感情色彩，作者的背景，我读了诗之后的感想，完全不存在的。

但是从某天起——不知道具体是什么时候，但是很显然，搬回github是一个转折点——我开始不仅仅满足于这一做法了。我想了解作者的背景，想了解诗歌的格律，我不太会读诗，但我会去网上找别人的解析来读。

这次搬运诗歌的时候，我的心理负担明显更重了——我想了解关于每首诗更多的东西。我甚至为了查证一首诗的作者（[Present in Absence](/post/present-in-absence-by-j-donne)）去查了专门的文献。这说明，我确实应该读得更认真了。在这个快要把第一卷读完的过程中——我很难说我的实际诗歌鉴赏水平是不是提高了（因为我也没有在仔细读诗这件事上多下功夫），但我确实了解了更多伊丽莎白一世和詹姆士一世时期的诗人和他们发生的故事，非常有趣，真的。

因为接下来需要变得更加认真，所以大概保证不了一天一首的频率了，但是也许在工作日两天一首还是可以的？总之，虽然要保证速度，不能停下来，也不能随便回头看，但是也要保证质量啊。（2018.7.22 UPDATE：这种频率完全保证不了啊，要干的事情太多了。）

## 如何读诗？

我在网上找了一篇相关的文章（[How to Analyze Poetry](https://cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/american-poets-of-the-20th-century/how-to-analyze-poetry)）。虽然这首诗针对的主要对象是20世纪美国诗人，但我感觉可以比较好的说明阅读大部分诗歌的这个问题。下面我尝试翻译一下这篇文章的内容。

>Poetry is a compact language that expresses complex feelings. To understand the multiple meanings of a poem, readers must examine its words and phrasing from the perspectives of rhythm, sound, images, obvious meaning, and implied meaning. Readers then need to organize responses to the verse into a logical, point-by-point explanation. A good beginning involves asking questions that apply to most poetry.

诗歌是一种浓缩了的语言，表达的是复杂的思想感情。为了理解一首诗的多重含义，读者必须从节奏、声音效果、意象、表面含义和隐含含义等方面仔细研究诗歌的词汇和句法。之后，读者需要将其对这首诗的思考和感受组织成一段逐点详述的有逻辑的说明文字。我们不妨从自问自答一些适用于大部分诗歌的问题开始。

### 诗歌的背景（Context of the Poem）

> Clear answers to the following questions can help establish the context of a poem and form the foundation of understanding:

如果你能够对以下问题清晰明了地做出回答，则你已经大致了解了一首诗的背景，这将为你对诗歌本身的理解打下较好的基础：

>* Who wrote the poem? Does the poet's life suggest any special point of view, such as a political affiliation, religious sect, career interest, musical talent, family or personal problems, travel, or handicap — for example, H. D.'s feminism, Amiri Baraka's radicalism, T. S. Eliot's conversion to Anglicanism, William Carlos Williams' career as a physician, A. R. Ammons' training in chemistry, Amy Lowell's aristocratic background, John Berryman's alcoholism, or Hart Crane's homosexuality?
* When was the poem written and in what country? Knowing something about the poet's life, times, and culture helps readers understand what's in a poem and why.
* Does the poem appear in the original language? If not, readers should consider that translation can alter the language and meaning of a poem.
* Is the poem part of a special collection or series? Examples of such series and collections include Edna St. Vincent Millay's sonnets, Carl Sandburg's Chicago Poems, or Rita Dove's triad, "Adolescence — I, II, and III."
* Does the poem belong to a particular period or literary movement? For example, does the poem relate to imagism, confessional verse, the Beat movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Civil Rights era, the American Indian renaissance, or feminism?

* 谁撰写了这首诗？这位诗人的生平是否暗示了一些不同的视角，比如政治立场、宗教信仰、职业志趣、音乐天赋、家庭和个人问题、旅行或残疾——例如，H. D.的女性主义，阿米里·巴卡拉（Amiri Baraka）的激进主义，T. S. 艾略特对英国国教的皈依，威廉·卡洛斯·威廉斯（William Carlos Williams）的医生职业，A. R. Ammons的化学训练，艾米·洛威尔（Amy Lowell）的艺术背景，约翰·贝里曼（John Berryman）的酗酒，以及哈特·克莱恩（Hart Crane）的同性恋倾向？（打扰了，这些人除了艾略特我一个都没听说过……）
* 这首诗是在何时何地创作的？了解关于诗人的生活、时代和文化的更多信息能够帮助读者理解诗中描写的是什么，以及为什么会描写这些。
* 你是否在使用撰写这首诗的语言来阅读这首诗？如果不是的话，读者需要考虑到，翻译可能会改变诗歌的语言风格和含义。
* 这首诗是否是某个特殊选集或系列中的一首？这样的选集和系列的例子包括埃德娜·圣文森特·米蕾（Edna St. Vincent Millay）的十四行诗集，卡尔·桑德堡（Carl Sandburg）的*Chicago Poems*，以及丽塔·达夫（Rita Dove）的三部曲，*Adolescence — I, II, and III*。
* 这首诗是否属于某个特定的时期或文学运动？比如，这首诗是否与意象主义运动、自白式诗歌、垮掉的一代、哈莱姆文艺复兴、民权时代、美国印第安裔复兴或女性主义相关？（打扰了，只听说过垮掉的一代和女权）

### 诗歌的风格（Style of the Poem）

>Into what category does the poem fit — for example, Carl Sandburg's imagism in "Fog" or Gwendolyn Brooks' epic "The Anniad"? Readers should apply definitions of the many categories to determine which describes the poem's length and style:

这首诗属于何种类别——比如，卡尔·桑德堡在*Fag*中的意象主义和格温多琳·布鲁克斯（格温多琳·布鲁克斯）的史诗*The Anniad*？读者应该使用这些种类的定义来确定到底如何描述诗歌的长度和风格：

>* Is it an epic, a long poem about a great person or national hero?
* Is it a lyric, a short, musical verse?
* Is it a narrative, a poem that tells a story?
* Is it a haiku, an intense, lyrical three-line verse of seventeen syllables?
* Is it confessional? For example, does it examine personal memories and experiences?

* 这是一首史诗吗？它是否描写了一位伟大的人或者一位国家英雄？
* 这是一首歌词吗？它是否简短而富有音乐性？
* 这是一首叙事诗吗？它是否讲述了一个故事？
* 这是一首俳句吗？它是否只有紧凑的3行，共17个音节？
* 这是一首自白式诗歌吗？比如说，它是否仔细审查了个人回忆和经历？

---

对于目前阅读的英诗，大概只要区分不同的格式和体裁（抒情/叙事）就好了。

### 诗歌的题目（Title of the Poem）

* Is the title's meaning obvious? For example, does it mention a single setting and action, such as W. S. Merwin's "The Drunk in the Furnace" or James A. Wright's "Autumn Begins in Martins Ferry, Ohio"?
* Does it imply multiple possibilities? For example, Jean Toomer's "Georgia Dusk," which refers to a time of day as well as to dark-skinned people.
* Does it strike a balance, as in Rita Dove's "Beulah and Thomas"?
* Is there an obvious antithesis, as with Robert Frost's "Fire and Ice"?
* Is there historical significance to the title? For example, Robert Lowell's "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket."

### 诗歌中的重复（Repetition in the Poem）

Readers should read through a poem several times, at least once aloud. If it is a long poem, such as Allen Ginsberg's Howl or Hart Crane's The Bridge, readers should concentrate on key passages and look for repetition of specific words, phrases, or verses in the poem.

Why is there a repeated reference to the sea in Robinson Jeffers's poetry?
Why does the pronoun "we" recur in Gwendolyn Brooks' "We Real Cool"?
Why does Edgar Lee Masters reprise epitaphs for Spoon River Anthology?
If readers note repetition in the poem, they should decide why certain information seems to deserve the repetition.

Opening and Closing Lines of the Poem

Does the poet place significant information or emotion in these places? For example, when reading Marianne Moore's "Poetry," readers may question the negative stance in the opening lines.
Does the poet intend to leave a lasting impression by closing with a particular thought? For example, why does Langston Hughes' "Harlem" lead to the word "explode"?
Passage of Time in the Poem

Can readers pin down a time frame? What details specify time?
Does the poet name a particular month or season, as with Amy Lowell's "Patterns"?
Is there a clear passage of time, as with the decline of the deceased woman in Denise Levertov's "Death in Mexico"?
How long is the period of time? Are there gaps?
Speaker of the Poem

Who is the speaker? Is the person male or female?
Does the voice speak in first person (I, me, my, mine), for example, John Berryman's "Huffy Henry"?
Does the speaker talk directly to a second person, as with Adrienne Rich's "Diving into the Wreck"?
Is the voice meant to be universal — for example, applicable to either sex at any time or place?
Names of Characters

Does the name of a character suggest extra meaning, such as Eben Flood (an alcoholic) in Edwin Arlington Robinson's "Mr. Flood's Party" and T. S. Eliot's prissy protagonist in "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"?
Basic Details of the Poem

Is the poet deliberately concealing information from the readers, as with the source of depression in Robert Lowell's "Skunk Hour"?
Why does the poet leave out significant facts? Are readers supposed to fill in the blanks, for example, the relationship between mother and daughter in Cathy Song's "The White Porch" or the perplexity of a modern tourist in Allen Tate's "Ode to the Union Dead"?
Culture

Does the poem stress cultural details, such as the behavior, dress, or speech habits of a particular group or a historical period or event — for instance, the death of an airline stewardess in James Dickey's "Falling"?
Are any sections written in dialect, slang, or foreign words, as with the Deep South patois of Sterling Brown's "Ma Rainey"?
Fantasy versus Reality

Is the poem an obvious fantasy, as is the case with the intense confrontation in Sylvia Plath's "Daddy" and the setting of Rita Dove's "Geometry"?
Mood and Tone of the Poem

What is the mood of the poem? Is it cheerful or jolly like limericks? Is it mysterious, provocative, zany, ominous, festive, fearful, or brooding, as with Randall Jarrell's "Sad Heart at the Supermarket"? Does the mood change within the body of the work, as with Joy Harjo's "The Woman Hanging from the Thirteenth Floor Window"? Why does the mood shift? Where does the shift begin?
What is the poet's tone? Is it satiric, serious, mock serious, playful, somber, brash, or teasingly humorous, as with Robert Frost's "Departmental: The End of My Ant Jerry"? Does the poet admire, agree with, ridicule, or condemn the speaker, as in the touch of mock heroic in Richard Wilbur's "The Death of a Toad"? Is there an obvious reason for the poet's attitude, as suggested by the suffering in James Dickey's "Angina"? Does the poet withhold judgment, as is the case with the epitaphs of Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology?
Themes of the Poem

Locating and identifying theme is crucial to understanding dominant ideas; theme is the poem's essence.

Is the subject youth, loss, renewal, patriotism, nature, love? Are there several themes? How do these themes relate to each other?
Is the poet merely teasing or entertaining or trying to teach a lesson, as do Robinson Jeffers' "Hurt Hawks" and Marianne Moore's "The Mind Is an Enchanted Thing"?
Does the poet emphasize the theme by means of onomatopoeia, personification, or controlling images?
Rhythm of the Poem

Is there a dominant rhythm? Does it dance, frolic, meander, slither, or march? Is it conversational, like a scene from a drama? Is it a droning monologue, as found in a journal, diary, or confessional?
Does the rhythm relate to the prevalent theme of the poem? Or does it seem at odds with the theme?
Does the rhythm increase or decrease in speed, as does Ezra Pound's Hugh Selwyn Mauberley: Life and Contacts? Why?
Use of the Senses in the Poem

Does the poem stress sense impressions — for example, taste, touch, smell, sound, or sight? Are these impressions pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral?
Does the poet concentrate on a single sense or a burst of sensation, as in Wallace Stevens's "Peter Quince at the Clavier" or Elizabeth Bishop's "The Fish"?
Imagery in the Poem

Are there concrete images or pictures that the poet wants readers to see?
Are the pictures created by means of comparisons — for instance, metaphor or simile? Do inanimate objects take on human traits (personification)? Does the speaker talk to inanimate objects or to such abstract ideas as freedom?
Language of the Poem

Does the poet stress certain sounds, such as pleasant sounds (euphony) or harsh letter combinations (cacophony), as demonstrated by Wendy Rose's title "Academic Squaw"?
Are certain sounds repeated (alliteration, sibilance), as in the insistent a sounds in Amiri Baraka's "A Poem for Willie Best"?
Are words linked by approximate rhyme, like "seem/freeze," or by real rhyme, such as "least/feast"? Is there a rhyme scheme or sound pattern at the ends of lines, as with the interlocking rhymes of Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"? Does rhyming occur within a line (internal rhyme), as in "black flak" in Randall Jarrell's "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner"?
Is there onomatopoeia, or words that make a sound that imitates their meaning, such as swoosh, ping pong, ricochet, clangor, plash, wheeze, clack, boom, tingle, slip, fumble, or clip-clop, as with the verb "soar" in Edna St. Vincent Millay's "On Thought in Harness"?
Supplemental Materials

Has the editor included any preface, explanatory notes, or concluding comments and questions; for example, T. S. Eliot's dedication of The Waste Land or Wendy Rose's use of epigraphs?
Are there notes and comments in a biography, poet's letters and essays, critical analyses, Web site, or anthology, such as biographical footnotes to Anne Sexton's "Sylvia's Death" and the many commentaries on Hart Crane's The Bridge?
Is there an electronic version, such as the poet reading original verse on the Internet? Are there notes on the record jacket, cassette box, or CD booklet, as found on recordings of Adrienne Rich's feminist verse?
Drawing Conclusions

After answering the questions presented in this introduction, readers should paraphrase or restate the poem in everyday words, as though talking to someone on the telephone. A summary of the poem should emphasize a pattern of details, sounds, or rhythm. For example, do various elements of the poem lead readers to believe that the poet is describing an intense experience? Is the poet defining something, such as parenthood, risking a life, curiosity, marriage, religious faith, or aging, as in Denise Levertov's "A Woman Alone"? Is the poet telling a story event by event? Does the poet want to sway the reader's opinion, as Louise Bogan does in "Evening in the Sanitarium"?

Before reaching a conclusion about the meaning of a poem, readers should summarize their personal responses. Are they emotionally moved or touched by the poem? Are they entertained or repulsed, terrified or stirred to agree? Do words and phrases stick in their memory? How has the poet made an impression? And most important, why?
