## 歌词和翻译

| 歌词 | 翻译 |
| --- | ---- |
| "There's no place for me." | “我无处可去。” |
| A man of nowhere, a man of black heart from the dead end streets
| "Regret runs through me | “我内心充满悔恨 |
| I am no one, I am nothing, I am a man of defeat | 我谁都不是，我什么都不是，我是一个失败者 |
| "What's left for me? What's left for me?" | “我还剩下些什么？我还剩下些什么？” |
| Thought of those open roads, his mother praying all alone | 他想到
That vagrant anthem and the field sung hymns
The cowardice forever following him

What's left, what's left for me?
The world has turned it's back on me

There's no place for me
A sullen walk to the chapel stairs
Regret runs through me
A hard pull on that white oak door to face up those fears

There's no place for me

"What brings you here my son?"
"I've been a horrible man
I killed my father, I killed my brother
I left my mother in your God's hands."
"Clasp your hands and count your sins
Kneel at the pew until the sermon begins
No judgment cast down this day, we'll set you free
You are forgiven my son, you are blessed and redeemed
You have found absolution here son, but only from me."

"What's left, what's left for me?"
A sullen walk to the steeple top to look over the city
He carves his name in that old brass bell
So when it rings he can hear it in hell
One last look to that western sky
One last wish he could have changed his life
"I ain't, ain't no wicked man."
He let his fleet slip from under him, unwanted
