| 歌词                                                    | 翻译                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Lately last night, I was asked to a wedding             | 昨天晚上，我被邀请参加一场婚礼               |
| The wedding of a fair maid who proved to me unkind      | 一位对我不忠实的姑娘的婚礼                   |
| For that day as she thought of her intended young lover | 那天她想着自己年轻的未婚夫的时候             |
| Thoughts of her old one had run through her mind        | 旧爱是否也曾浮现于她的脑海之中               |
| Supper being over and all things were ended             | 晚餐撤下，一切都结束了                       |
| Every young man was to sing a fine song                 | 每个年轻人都得唱一首美好的歌谣               |
| Until it came to the turn of her own foreign lover      | 直到轮到了她自己曾经的恋人                   |
| And the song that he sang to the bride did belong       | 他向新娘唱起了这样一首歌谣                   |
| How can you sit at another man's table?                 | 你怎能坐在别人的桌前？                       |
| How can you drink of another man's wine?                | 你怎能饮下别人的酒？                         |
| How can you lie in the arms of another?                 | 你怎能躺在别人的臂弯中？                     |
| Many's the night, love, that you lay in mine            | 亲爱的，你在我的怀里度过了多少夜晚           |
| Many's the one has been seven years parted              | 多少人和恋人分开了七年                       |
| Seven years parted and did return again                 | 分开了七年，还是回到她身边                   |
| But I have only been two years away, love               | 但是亲爱的，我只离开了两年                   |
| Two years away, love, and did return again              | 只有两年，我还是回到了你身边                 |
| The bride, she was seated at the head of the table      | 新娘坐在桌子的一端                           |
| Very well she knew to whom the song did belong          | 她多么熟悉唱这首歌的人                       |
| Her heart it grew faint, she could stand it no longer   | 她头晕目眩，她已无法承受这些                 |
| Down at the feet of the bridegroom she fell             | 她倒在新郎的脚边                             |
| Sobbing and sighing she rose from the table             | 抽泣叹息着离开了桌边                         |
| Sobbing and sighing she went to her bed                 | 抽泣叹息着回到了床上                         |
| Early next morning the bridegroom awakened              | 第二天新郎醒得很早                           |
| He turned to embrace her and found she was dead         | 他转过身去拥抱她，却发现她已死去             |
| Saying, "Annie, dear Annie, I knew you never loved me   | 他说：“安妮，亲爱的安妮，我知道你从未爱过我  |
| My love and your love could never agree                 | 我的爱和你的爱永不会和谐                     |
| For I knew all along that your poor heart was breaking  | 因为我一直都知道，你可怜的心都碎了           |
| All for the sake of a foreign young man"                | 只为了一位遥远的年轻人”                      |
| So now I must wear a frock of deep mourning             | 所以现在我不得不穿上重丧服                   |
| A frock of deep mourning, one, two and three            | 一件，两件，三件重丧服                       |
| I must wear to her wake my own wedding garment          | 我将穿上自己的婚礼服为她守夜                 |
| Ne'er again shall I go between the bark and the tree    | 我永不会再打扰夫妇之间的事                   |

1. “to her wake”：我开始时不是很理解，于是查找了一些含有这个短语的网页（比如[这个](https://books.google.com/books?id=RjhhBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=%22to+her+wake%22&source=bl&ots=D5Iu91EVrD&sig=YNdppcPbl-K2-MznSoYUjRb5J-c&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHhLH3wYbfAhXQhOAKHdefAYQQ6AEwCHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22to%20her%20wake%22&f=false)和[这个](http://forums.sherdog.com/threads/dragging-my-feet-about-to-go-to-her-wake.3745621/)），于是我终于发现，wake有“（葬礼前的）守夜”这个义项。
