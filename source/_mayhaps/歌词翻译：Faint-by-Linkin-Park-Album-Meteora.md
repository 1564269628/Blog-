| [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda] | |
| I am a little bit of loneliness | 我身上有一点点孤独 |
| A little bit of disregard | 有一点点被漠视 |
| Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact | 满是抱怨，但我改变不了 |
| That everyone can see these scars | 别人都能看见这些伤痕的事实 |
| I am what I want you to want | 我想让你渴望我所渴望的 |
| What I want you to feel | 感受我所感受的 |
| But, it's like no matter what I do | 但是好像无论我怎么做 |
| I can't convince you to just believe this is real | 我连说服你这是真的都做不到 |
| [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda] | |
| So, I let go, watching you | 所以，我放弃了，看着你 |
| Turn your back like you always do | 背过身去，像你往常所做的那样 |
| Face away and pretend that I'm not
| But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
| 
| [Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
| I can't feel the way I did, before
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| Time won't heal this damage, anymore
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| 
| [Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
| I am a little bit insecure
| A little unconfident
| 'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
| But sometimes, I don't make sense
| 
| I am what you never wanna say
| But, I've never had a doubt
| It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
| For once, just to hear me out
| 
| [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
| So, I let go, watching you
| Turn your back like you always do
| Face away and pretend that I'm not
| But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
| 
| [Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
| I can't feel the way I did, before
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| Time won't heal this damage, anymore
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| 
| [Bridge: Chester Bennington]
| No, hear me out, now
| You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
| Right now, hear me out, now
| You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
| Right now
| 
| I can't feel the way I did before
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| 
| [Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
| I can't feel the way I did, before
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| Time won't heal this damage, anymore
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| 
| [Outro: Chester Bennington & both]
| I can't feel
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
| Time won't heal
| Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

我真的特别想说，这tm不就是我吗……那些不被人承认和接受的感受，那些不被人理解的痛苦……我是经常会放弃，但我也希望被理解。
