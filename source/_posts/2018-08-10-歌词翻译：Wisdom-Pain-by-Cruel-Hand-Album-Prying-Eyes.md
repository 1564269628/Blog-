>Anxiety inside of me, I'm starting to bust. Friends turn foe so easily, I need someone to fucking trust. Can't you see I need room to breathe and space is a must? Everything I know to be crumbles to dust. I can't stop this, it's beyond me. I have tried, are you not listening? Reality and what's "real to me" is what I cannot separate. Choosing one over the other is the reason why I'm fucking late. A window of opportunity smashed to bits and worthless to me. Constant inconsistency- my only consistency. So much wisdom in pain, so many lessons in hurt. You learn from a loss so I'll take on your worst. Nothing can hit harder than my own regret so I live with what I've done and know that I can't forget.

内心如此焦虑，我要开始破碎了。朋友们如此轻易地变成敌人，我需要我能他妈的信任的人。难道你看不出我需要地方透气，必须有一些空间吗？我所知道的一切都将碎成粉末。我无法阻止这些，这超出了我的能力。我已经努力过了，难道你没在听吗？我无法区分现实和“我眼中的现实”。我需要从中选择一种，因此我他妈的迟了。机遇之窗已被砸得粉碎，对我再无价值。我永远反复无常——这是我唯一始终不渝的地方。这么多来自痛苦的智慧，这么多来自伤害的教训。你从失败中吸取经验，所以我会承受最坏的情况。没有什么能比我自己的后悔更深地打击到我，所以我和我的过去生活在一起，我知道我无法忘记它们。

<!--
Friends turn foe... Everything I know to be crumbles to dust一句让我想到了《Hurt》里的这一段：

what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

Are you not listening是让对方认真听，还是在怀疑对方有没有听？

why I'm fucking late——迟到，or简单的“迟”？

 I'll take on your worst是什么意思？

Nothing can hit harder than my own regret这句让我想到了《Easier to Run》里的这一段：

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would

以及《What I've Done》：

So let mercy come
And wash away
What I’ve done
I’ll face myself
To cross out
What I’ve become

这个歌词的核心大概就是“破碎”——bust, crumble, smash...
