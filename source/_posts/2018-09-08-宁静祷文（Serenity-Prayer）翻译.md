宁静祷文（Serenity Prayer）是神学家[莱因霍尔德·尼布尔](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr)所作的一篇祷告，最初通过尼布尔的讲道和教会团体传播，后来因[嗜酒者无名会](http://www.aa-beijing.org/)（[Alcoholics Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous)）等组织将其用于[十二步项目](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%8C%E6%AD%A5%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE)（[Twelve-step program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program)）而广为流传。

## 另一版本

在这一版本中，祷文中增加了“责任”，并且尝试在这种主动的责任感和深刻的接纳感之间进行平衡。这里的祷文形式是“祝福”（“May I ...”），但很容易修改为“祈祷”（“God grant me the ...”）。当然上一个版本也是这样的。[^mike]

[^mike]: [The Serenity Prayer](http://healingcollective.org/the-serenity-prayer/)

>May I take deep responsibility for all the consequence of my actions, both intentional and unintentional.
>May I take deep responsibility for my emotional states.
>May I take deep responsibility for everything I control and everything over which I have some sort of influence.
>
>May I accept complete surrender in all those aspects of life in which I have absolutely no control or influence.
>May I cultivate tremendous trust and acceptance wherever my control and influence end.
>May I relax into the deep vulnerability of human life.
>
>And between what I control and what I do not, what I influence and what I do not, may I have the wisdom, the courage, and the insight to know the difference.
