## 作品原文

To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eyes I eyed
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> three summers' pride;

Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
Since first I saw you fresh, which<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a> yet are green.

Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal<a href="#note3" id="note3ref"><sup>3</sup></a> from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still<a href="#note4" id="note4ref"><sup>4</sup></a> doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:

For dear of which, hear this, thou age unbred,—
Ere you<a href="#note5" id="note5ref"><sup>5</sup></a> were born, was beauty's summer dead.

## 脚注
<a id="note1" href="#note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>*hook*: for 'shaken' is not common in the 17th century, which often used the past tense of strong verbs in place of the past participle.
<a id="note2" href="#note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a>*which*: for 'who' is often found in Shakespeare and his contemporaries; it occurs frequently in the Authorised Version of the Bible (1611), notably in the Lord's Prayer. （在莎士比亚及其同时代人中，用“which”来代替“who”是常见用法，比如在钦定版圣经里就很常见，特别是在主祷文里。）
<a id="note3" href="#note3ref"><sup>3</sup></a>*Steal*: I take to be intransitive, and his to be put for 'its, 'i.e. beauty's, beauty slowly vanishes from the figure it adorns, as the hand steals imperceptibly round the clock.
<a id="note4" href="#note4ref"><sup>4</sup></a>*still*: is the adjective, going with 'stand.'
<a id="note5" href="#note5ref"><sup>5</sup></a>Posterity is addressed collectively in the former line, individually in the latter, where 'you' = 'any of you.'
