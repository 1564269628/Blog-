## 作品原文

Forget not yet the tried intent<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>
of such a truth as I have meant;
My great travail<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a> so gladly spent,
Forget not yet!

Forget not yet when first began
The weary life ye know, since whan
The suit<a href="#note3" id="note3ref"><sup>3</sup></a>, the service<a href="#note4" id="note4ref"><sup>4</sup></a> none tell can;
Forget not yet!

Forget not yet the great assays<a href="#note5" id="note5ref"><sup>5</sup></a>,
The cruel wrong, the scornful ways,
The painful patience in delays,
Forget not yet!

Forget not! O, forget not this,
How long ago hath been, and is
The mind that never meant amiss—<a href="#note6" id="note6ref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Forget not yet!

Forget not then thine own approved<a href="#note7" id="note7ref"><sup>7</sup></a>
The which so long has thee so loved,
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved—
Forget not this!


## 译文
### 林天斗 译
可别忘记我所表示的
如此一片忠诚的真切意愿；
我莫大的痛苦已那么愉快地完成，
可别忘记！

可别忘记当初开始
你知道的那厌倦的生活，从此
那种乞求，那种服务真是难以述说；
可别忘记！

可别忘记那些严重的考验，
那残酷的屈辱，藐视的方式，
几次拖延了的痛苦的忍耐，
可别忘记！

别忘记！咳，不要把这忘记，
多久以前已经是，现在也是
这决不能被误解的心意——
可别忘记！

别忘记还有你自己赞许的
那个你曾如此长久爱过的人，
他的坚贞信念可永不动摇——
不要把这忘记！

## 我的感想

我本来不想写什么东西，但是看到了一个让我差点笑死的八卦，不妨摘录如下（据说以下内容是怀亚特写给亨利八世的信）：
>“Your Majesty knows that before marrying Queen Anne you said to me, Wyatt, I am going to marry Anne Boleyn, what do you think of it? I told your Majesty the that you had better not do so, and you asked me why; to which I replied that she was a bad woman, and your Majesty angrily ordered me to quit your presence for two years. Your majesty did not deign on that occasion to ask my reasons for saying what I did, and since I could not then give them by word of mouth, I will do so now in writing. One day, whilst Mistress Anne’s father and mother were at the Court eight miles from Greenwich, where, as all world knows, they were stationed, I took horse and went thither, arriving when Anne was already in bed. I mounted to her chamber and as soon as she saw me she said, “Good God! Master Wyatt, what are you doing here at this hour?’ I answered her, ‘Lady, a heart tormented as mine has been by yours for long past has urged me hither to ask for some consolation from one who has caused it so much pain.’ I approached her and kissed her, and she remained quiet and silent, and even to still greater familiarities she made no objection, when suddenly I heard a great stamping over the bed in which she slept, and the lady at once rose, slipped on a skirt, and went out by a staircase which led up behind the bed; I waited for her more than an hour but when she came down she would not allow me to approach her.
“I cannot but believe that I was treated in the same way as a gentleman once was in Italy, who was as madly in love with a lady as I was, and was, by his good luck, brought to the same point, when he heard a stamping overhead and the lady rose and went out; but the gentleman in question was wiser than I, for he very soon followed the lady upstairs, and found her in the arms of a groom, and I have no doubt I should have seen the same thing if I had been wise enough to follow her. A week after she was quite at my service, and if your Majesty had deigned to hear me when you banished me, I would have told you then what I write you now.”

关于这件八卦更多的内容我参见的是<a href="#bib1" id="bib1ref"><sup>[1]</sup></a>。简单来说，安妮·博林在和怀亚特交往的时候脚踏两条船被发现了，怀亚特非常气愤，以至于在亨利八世咨询他“娶安妮·博林这件事怎么样”的时候，直言“安妮·博林是个坏女人”。亨利八世一怒之下没让他再多说话就决定驱逐他两年（似乎是关进了伦敦塔）；怀亚特在塔里写了这封信，讲了他被戴绿帽子的故事；亨利八世看了之后，立刻把他从塔里放了出来，并且更爱他了。（但是我怎么觉得这剧情有点不对，最后他不是仍然娶了安妮么）

这个八卦故事的主要依据是一部自称记述了亨利八世和爱德华一世时期发生的史实的西班牙语作品<a href="#bib2" id="bib2ref"><sup>[2]</sup></a>。一位历史学家把它翻译成了英语，但是也有人认为，这部作品并不真实<a href="#bib3" id="bib3ref"><sup>[3]</sup></a>。哎呀，我现在没时间去考据这个故事的真实性了，不过还真是有趣呢……
